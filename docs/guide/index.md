# Why?

## DX & modern tooling are important

There are currently no good UnoCSS based libraries for Vue3 that also work nicely with Vite.

## What?

This library aims to implement *All* the components and interface elements, helpers and utilities we/you might need to build any kind of app.
Not a few handy components that make you use several UI packages and get wrinkles trying to make them work together.

### Design system

We find it practical to have a design system power a user interface library. This allows you to fit the UI library exactly where and how your brand needs.

But with added features like:
- visual accessibility and color-blindness checks for your theme
- previewing the whole library in one place, while configuring the design

### Templates

There is a fine line between a user interface library and we aim to cross it.

Using both layout, page and smaller UI elements from the same library seems to us to be a much more efficient and maintainable way of doing things.

## How?

- keep things light weight (tree shakeable)
- export proper types
- use css variables to allow the simplest posible customization
- properly documented
- tested (TODO)
